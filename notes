* Who we are & what we do. Who i am
  - TBD, chat with others what content
* Placing orders in the market (why!), why speed important
* FIX message:
  - 9=FIX4.2|blah|blah|blah|footer
  - Basically it's ASCII
* Strawman code
std::string newOrder(int product, int price, int quantity) {
  ostrstring s;
  s << "9=FIX4.2" << sep 
    << "blah" << sep;
  return s.str();
}
  - Timings! 1.2us / record ! yay
* So what all is going on there?
  - perf? ask the audience?
  - Memory alloc? Try sprintf
* sprintf version
  - 330ns/iter
  - profile shows hotspots in vfprintf and itoa_word, source?
  - disassembly?
  - dependency chain?
* Can we do better?
  - itoa?

  - How to send quickly?
* How quick is quick? Let's measure. focus on itoa
  - ostream version -> 1850 clocks (on my laptop, 0.8us)
  - printf into buffer -> 328 clocks
  - fastFormat -> 84 clks (with reversal)
  - fastFormatFixed -> 64 clks (no reversal)
  ...with even faster code ~40clks

* Any questions? We're hiring, come chat with me...

Non-slide notes.
* It's probably possible to speed up non-fixed case with log10 and then a per-log10 routine.
* log10 can be found with "count leading zero" instruction and a small lookup table
  * or even using a parallel divide (mult by recip) and then CLZ to find not only the answer
    but the number of 0s at front
